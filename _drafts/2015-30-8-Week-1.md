This is my first week as a student in Professor Downing's Object-Oriented Programming class (CS 371P).  I have heard great things about how much I'm going to learn in the course, and I'm looking forward to getting started.

Due to unusual circumstances, I wasn't able to attend the two class meetings this week, so I am using this weekend to frantically catch up.  Fortunately, a friend in the class kindly agreed to take notes for me, so I am learning from them as best I can.  I don't know if I will be completely caught up by Monday, but I'm hoping that by Wednesday I will be entirely back on track.

Therefore, instead of writing about the course content, I would like to take a little time to talk about a different topic: software engineering job interviews.  The format of these interviews can vary a great deal, but a common process is to have a phone screening (or perhaps an on-campus interview at your university) followed by an on-site interview.  The on-site interview may require traveling across the country, with flights, hotels, and food paid for by the candidate's potential employers.

When I consider the cost of transporting a candidate to an on-site interview, I start to understand what a big expense the hiring process is for a company, and why top software companies try so hard to retain their best people after they have found them.  After all, they have invested a lot of effort in identifying suitable employees.  The costs aren't limited to transportation, either: large companies employ small armies of full-time recruiters and travel coordinators to help candidates through the process.  And during the phone screening and on-site interviews, engineers who already work for the company invest hours of their valuable time assessing a candidate's skills.  These are hours that could have been spent working on the company's products.

As a result, it’s not just candidates who benefit from preparing as much as possible for interviews.  Companies have an incentive to help candidates prepare, too, so that they can present their skills as clearly as possible without getting thrown off by something small.

Recruiters I’ve spoken with over the years have given me lots of interview preparation tips.  I’ll close this post with a tip-of-the-week about an interview preparation book I’ve had recommended to me over and over again: [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/cracking-the-coding-interview-5th-edition-gayle-laakmann-mcdowell/1111307918) Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.  If you expect to have interviews in the next few months, it’s never too early to start brushing up on those skills and dusting off the part of your brain which contains the stuff you learned in CS 314.
