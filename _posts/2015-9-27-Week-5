Week 5 was the week our second programming project (Voting) was due.  It was our first pair programming project, and I was really pleased at how well my partner and I worked together.  I think we worked more efficiently together than alone.  Working quickly was especially important this week due to the career fair and all the stress accompanying recruiting season (which by the way is fairly horrible).

Sometimes I'm surprised at the stereotype of software engineers as highly introverted, socially awkward folk who emerge from their caves only for Mountain Dew and pizza.  My classes and my internships have taught me that being able to work with other people is a hugely important skill for software engineers to have.  Just because we're not salespeople or politicians doesn't mean we have no need to be persuasive, express ideas clearly, or be tactful when working with others.  As a triple major with Psychology and Rhetoric & Writing, maybe I'm biased about the importance of these types of skills, but I really think they're a boon in almost every profession and that software engineering is no exception.

Aside from its practical advantages, programming with another person is more enjoyable and motivational than working alone, at least for me.  

This week's tip-of-the-week is a nod to a book that has been called "the classic introduction to C++ by its creator": [The C++ Programming Language](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0201700735/?tag=stackoverfl08-20) by Bjarne Stroustrup.  I have become intrigued by how challenging and powerful C++ seems to be as a language, and online reviews recommended this book.  However, it is clearly not for the faint-hearted, seeing as the latest edition is 1030 pages!
